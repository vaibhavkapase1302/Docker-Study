### Docker PostgreSQL Port Conflict Resolution

Here's a template you can use for your `README.md` file on GitHub, documenting the problem and the solution:

#### Problem Statement

While running two instances of PostgreSQL on Docker, both instances attempted to bind to the same default port (`5432`). This resulted in a port conflict, preventing one of the containers from starting successfully.

### Solution

To resolve the port conflict, we utilized Docker Compose to manage the container configurations and assigned different port numbers to each PostgreSQL container. This allowed both containers to run simultaneously without any conflicts.

### Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. **Dockerfile Setup:**
    - We created a `Dockerfile` based on the official PostgreSQL image.
    - The image was built using the `docker build` command.

    ```dockerfile
    # Dockerfile
    FROM postgres:latest

    ENV POSTGRES_USER=root√ü
    ENV POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword

    EXPOSE 5432
    ```

    - Build the image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t my_custom_postgres .
    ```

2. **Running the Containers:**
    - Initially, we tried to run two PostgreSQL containers using the following commands:

    ```bash
    docker run --name <container_name> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> -e POSTGRES_USER=<root> -p 5432:5432 -d postgres   
    ```
    
    ```bash
    docker run --name postgres_instance_1 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e POSTGRES_USER=root -p 5432:5432 -d my_custom_postgres
    ```

    ```bash
    docker run --name postgres_instance_2 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=anotherpassword -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -p 5432:5432 -d my_custom_postgres
    ```

    - This led to a conflict since both containers were trying to use port `5432`.

#### Resolution Using Docker Compose

Docker Compose was used to assign different external port numbers to each container, while the internal container ports remained the same (`5432`).

**Method 1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` File:**

    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      postgres_instance_1:
        image: my_custom_postgres
        environment:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
          POSTGRES_USER: root
        ports:
          - "5432:5432"

      postgres_instance_2:
        image: my_custom_postgres
        environment:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: anotherpassword
          POSTGRES_USER: admin
        ports:
          - "5433:5432"
    ```

    - In this configuration:
      - `postgres_instance_1` is exposed on port `5432`.
      - `postgres_instance_2` is exposed on port `5433`.

2. **Run the Containers Using Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    - The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode.

3. **Verification:**

    - Both PostgreSQL instances should now be running without any port conflicts.
    - You can verify this by listing the running containers and checking the ports:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    - The output should indicate that one container is mapped to `localhost:5432` and the other to `localhost:5433`.
  
  **Method 2. Changing port no. at the time of docker run**

    docker run --name postgres_instance_1 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e POSTGRES_USER=root -p 5432:5432 -d my_custom_postgres

    docker run --name postgres_instance_2 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=anotherpassword -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -p 5433:5432 -d my_custom_postgres

#### Conclusion

By using Docker Compose, we successfully resolved the port conflict issue and allowed both PostgreSQL containers to run simultaneously. This method can be extended to manage more complex Docker setups, ensuring that services run smoothly without port collisions.
